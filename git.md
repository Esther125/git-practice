### How to write a good commit message?
+ Be precise but complete.
+ Better to start with a verb.
+ It's good to add some prefix such as
    + `feat`: Indicates a new feature is added to the project.
    + `fix`: Indicates a bug fix.
    + `readme`: Changes made to the README file for documentation purposes.
    + `refactor`: Code changed that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    + `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    + `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

    to make people understand what this commit has done quickly.
    
+ Include References to ticket or issue number that the commit is related to. (e.g., `See #123`, `Closes #456`)
