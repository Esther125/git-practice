### What I intended to do after watching the video
- **Adopt a Growth Mindset:** Always maintain a _growth mindset_ rather than a fixed one. This mindset emphasizes the potential to develop and improve through perseverance and effort.
- **Remove Self-Imposed Limitations:** Understand that our brains are capable of _continuous growth_ and that we _should not impose unnecessary limitations on ourselves_.
- **Embrace Mistakes:** Do not fear making mistakes, as they are essential for progress and learning.
- **Test Myself:** When learning something new, testing oneself is an effective method to enhance understanding.
- **Explore Different Methods:** Trying various approaches when learning new techniques or knowledge can lead to more comprehensive learning outcomes.
- **Deep Understanding Over Quick Learning:** When acquiring new knowledge, it is crucial to grasp the underlying concepts and principles deeply rather than quickly. A deep understanding ensures _long-lasting retention_.
- **Learn Collaboratively:** Cooperating or learning with others can be a highly effective way to understand complex subjects more deeply.
- **Teach Others:** When grasp a new concept, trying to assist others who may not understand it yet. _Explaining ideas to others_ can reinforce my own understanding and help both my peers and me learn more effectively.
